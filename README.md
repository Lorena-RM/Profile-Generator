## [Tests](#table-of-contents)
> **Note:** the screenshots below is an **example only** of the **team.html** that would be created after answering terminal questions. This is being used as a test for users to see what the html would look like when impits have been answered.

This **team.html** is included when this project is cloned into your system. once inputs have been completed within your terminal, the methods inside of the code override the current example "team.html" with your new inputs of your own personal team.
